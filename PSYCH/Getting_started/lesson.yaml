  Output: First, I will provide you with Notes for the module. You can save these in a new R script document (click on icon in upper left corner to make a new file-->select R script).

- Class: text
  Output: I recommend that as soon as the Notes pop up that you save them as "R guide" or a title that is useful for you. In future modules when notes pop up you can copy and paste them into your R guide.

  Output: We recommend you copy and paste the notes for the Module into this separate Script and save it as something memorable in a place you can find it.

  Output: Once you've copied and pasted the Notes, the instructions will tell you to type submit() to move on to the module.

  Output: After you have gotten the notes, the module will teach the lesson. As the swirl() instructions mentioned, if you see a ..., it means hit enter. If you're lost, getting the wrong answer will give you a hint. If you're still confused, you can use skip() to get the answer given to you.
