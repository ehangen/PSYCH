  Output: Hello! Through these learning modules, you will practice and learn the tools to perform analyses in R to run common statisical analyses to test hypotheses and create data visuals.

- Class: text
  Output: Each module should take between 10 to 20 minutes to complete. However, to best assist your learning of R, I recommend that you take longer.

- Class: text
  Output: Each module will follow the same basic form.
  
- Class: text
  Output: First, I will provide you with Notes for the module. You can save these in a new R script document (click on icon in upper left corner to make a new file-->select R script).

- Class: text
  Output: I recommend that as soon as the Notes pop up that you save them as "R guide" or a title that is useful for you. In future modules when notes pop up you can copy and paste them into your R guide.

- Class: text
  Output: We recommend you copy and paste the notes for the Module into this separate Script and save it as something memorable in a place you can find it. 

- Class: text
  Output: Once you've copied and pasted the Notes, the instructions will tell you to type submit() to move on to the module.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The Notes script will look like this (hit enter to see).

- Class: script
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('saved')
  Output: STOP! You should now see a R script open with notes. Please copy and paste these notes into your R reference guide and save the your R guide. After you have updated and saved your guide, click to put your cursor back below here (in the console) and type submit()
  Script: Notes.R

- Class: text
  Output: After you have gotten the notes, the module will teach the lesson. As the swirl() instructions mentioned, if you see a ..., it means hit enter. If you're lost, getting the wrong answer will give you a hint. If you're still confused, you can use skip() to get the answer given to you.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The === bar represents your progress through the module, along with the percentage number to indicate how far into the module you are.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Some of the questions may be command-line questions. It would be best if you typed in your answers into the Console. For example, I might ask you to calculate 2+2. Try that now, by typing 2+2 into the console and then hit enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 2+2
  Hint: Did you try adding the two numbers together?
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2+2')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Other questions may be multiple-choice questions. To answer these, you can choose the number corresponding to the answer or type the answer out yourself. For example, the name of this SWIRL course is PSYCH. What is the name of the course?
  AnswerChoices: PSYCH; R Programming; Statistics for Smarties; Don't Think Too Hard
  CorrectAnswer: PSYCH
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='PSYCH')
  Hint: Try typing PSYCH or choose the number that represents that answer. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Finally, other questions will show scripts and ask you to fill in the correct answers. We use these when you need to see how coding is written in a script instead of in the Console.

- Class: text
  Output: Please go through each module at least twice. For your first time, learn by going through the module. This will take time to read the instructions, consider what it asks, and trying your best to answer each question. When you finish the first time, make sure to copy and paste the completion code into Brightspace assignment so you get credit for completing the module.

- Class: text
  Output: Next, go through the entire module again. This time use your notes along with the R Guide to help you. Going through the module multiple times will help you remember what you have learned. The more repeats you do, the faster and better skilled you will become.


- Class: text
  Output: And that's it! Combined with the Course Notes, your Notes, and a few swirl rounds, you'll be a pro in no time.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is this your first time completing this module?
  AnswerChoices: Yes, I would like the completion code; No, I have already submitted the completion code on Brightspace for this module
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: go_to_brightspace_if_yes()
  Hint: hint
