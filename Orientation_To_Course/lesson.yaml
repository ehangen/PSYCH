- Class: text
  Output: Through these learning modules, you will practice and learn the tools to perform analyses in R to run common statisical analyses to test hypotheses and create data visuals.

- Class: text
  Output: Each module should take between 10 to 20 minutes to complete. However, to best assist your learning of R, I recommend that you take longer.

- Class: text
  Output: Each module will follow the same basic form.
  
- Class: text
  Output: First, I will provide you with Notes for the module. You can save these in a new R script document (click on icon in upper left corner to make a new file-->select R script).

- Class: figure
  Output: I recommend that as soon as the Notes pop up that you save them as "R guide" or a title that is useful for you. In future modules when notes pop up you can copy and paste them into your R guide.

  
- Class: text
  Output: We recommend you copy and paste the notes for the Module into this separate Script and save it as something memorable in a place you can find it. 

- Class: text
  Output: Once you've copied and pasted the Notes, the instructions will tell you to type submit() to move on to the module.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The Notes script will look like this (hit enter to see).

- Class: script
  Output: Here are some notes for this module. When you've saved the notes in your own personal Notes R Script, type submit().
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('saved')
  Hint: Make sure the last line in your script says saved <- "Y".
  Script: Notes.R

- Class: text
  Output: After that, the module will teach the lesson. As the swirl() instructions mentioned, if you see a ..., it means hit enter. If you're lost, getting the wrong answer will give you a hint. If you're still confused, you can use skip() to get the answer given to you.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The === bar represents your progress through the module, along with the percentage number to indicate how far into the module you are.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Some of the questions may be command-line questions. It would be best if you typed in your answers into the Console. For example, if I wanted you to calculate 2+2, I might say - take 2 and add 2 to it. Try that now. 
  CorrectAnswer: 2+2
  Hint: Did you try adding the two numbers together?
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2+2')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Other questions may be multiple-choice questions. To answer these, you can choose the number corresponding to the answer or type the answer out yourself. For example, the name of the course is PSYCH. What is the name of the course?
  AnswerChoices: PSYCH; R Programming; Swirl; Don't Think Too Hard
  CorrectAnswer: PSYCH
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='PSYCH')
  Hint: Try typing PSYCH or choose the number that represents that answer. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Finally, other questions will show scripts and ask you to fill in the correct answers. We use these when you need to see how coding is written in a script instead of in the Console.

- Class: text
  Output: We provide throughout the course all citations for any data we are using (all open access data) and any citations for any statistical choices we make.
  
- Class: text
  Output: We recommend that you go through each module twice. First, play through the module. Please read the instructions, consider what it asks, and try your best. If you are submitting this for a course, submit that to your professor (that'll come up at the end).

- Class: text
  Output: After you've done it once, do it again. But, this time, have your notes open. Take your notes along with the notes provided. The Notes.R will include all of the code you will use (and more) but won't contextualize it in terms of the studies analyzed in the course. 

- Class: text
  Output: Once you have done it twice, review the Notes you made and see how the functions work outside of a psychology dataset. Run the lines of code, read the Notes, and see if you can understand at a deeper level what is happening. 

- Class: text
  Output: And that's it! Combined with the Course Notes, your Notes, and a few swirl rounds, you'll be a pro in no time.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Would you like to submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so that your instructor may evaluate your progress?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
  Hint: hint
